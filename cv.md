## Brief Info
Graduated as a graphic designer.  
When working as a designer, I studied some HTML&CSS. Then, already as a project manager, I felt lack of technical skills and started studying JS basics. 
Eventually found myself switched to frontend developing, and now hope to brush up my scattered knowledge and improve skills ðŸ™‚

## Skills
- HTML, CSS, SASS
- Responsive design
- JavaScript
- Vue.js
- Git / GitHub

## Code Example
```
function isWalkValid(walkArr) {
  let x = 0
  let y = 0
  walkArr.forEach(walk => {
    if (walk === 'e') x += 1
    if (walk === 'w') x -= 1
    if (walk === 'n') y += 1
    if (walk === 's') y -= 1
  })
  return ((x === 0) && (y === 0) && (walkArr.length === 10))
}
```
